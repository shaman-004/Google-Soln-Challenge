Brief Description about the problem statement:
The concept behind providing educative material by assessing a child's grasping power and intelligence is to create a personalized learning experience for each individual child. This approach involves assessing a child's cognitive abilities and learning style and then tailoring the educational content and curriculum to meet their unique needs.

By doing this, we can help each child reach their full potential and achieve better learning outcomes. This approach can also make learning more enjoyable and engaging for the child, as they are more likely to find the material interesting and relevant to their interests and abilities.

To implement this approach, we can use various tools and techniques, such as cognitive assessments, adaptive learning algorithms, and personalized learning plans. These tools can help educators and parents create a more effective and efficient learning experience that is tailored to the child's individual strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, providing educative material by assessing a child's grasping power and intelligence is a powerful approach that can help children achieve better learning outcomes and enjoy the learning process.
